                        The Big Data from SAS website gives a full picture of what "big data" means, how it has changed over time, and how important it is in today's business world. The article's definition of "big data" includes the huge amounts of organized and unstructured data that businesses have to deal with every day. There is more to big data than just the amount or type of data it contains. What makes it different is how companies use it to make smart decisions. This piece talks about how big data analytics has changed the way businesses work today.

                        One of the most important things this site does give you a history view of big data. "Big data" may seem like a new buzzword, but it has been used in business for a long time. In the early 2000s, Doug Laney came up with the idea of the three V's: Volume, Velocity, and Variety. This is when most people started to understand what big data was. These three V's nicely describe the main problems and chances that big data brings. Volume refers to the huge amounts of data that need to be processed, Velocity to the speed at which data is created and must be processed, and Variety to the different types of data that come from different sources and are stored in different ways.
                        <br><hr>
                        The term "Big Data" brings attention to the many different places where companies get data. Some of these sources are transaction data, while others are the huge amounts of data that smart gadgets and the Internet of Things (IoT) create. The huge amount of data comes from things like industrial tools, videos, pictures, music, social media, and more. A long time ago, it would have been too expensive to store and manage such huge information. The task of storing data has become much easier thanks to new technologies like data lakes, Hadoop, and cloud storage options. Companies no longer have to worry about where to put their data; instead, they can focus on getting insights from it.
                        <br><hr>
                        Along with the three Vs, the piece adds two more dimensions, variability and truthfulness. Variability shows how random data flows are because they can change a lot and change often. This part of big data shows how important it is to have open and adaptable data analytics methods that can work well with these changes. On the other hand, veracity focuses on how good the info is. It is very important to make sure that the data being studied is correct, dependable, and free of any biases. When companies don't have good data, they might get wrong information and make bad decisions, which can have big effects on their business.
                        <br><hr>
                        The main point of the piece is "big data" is important because it lets businesses make smart choices by using the information they get from looking at huge, complicated datasets. Making decisions based on data is no longer a nice-to-have, it's a must in today's competitive world. Organizations that use big data to understand how customers behave, market trends, and how to run their businesses more efficiently gain a competitive edge. They can make their operations run more smoothly, come up with better new ideas, and quickly adapt to changes in the market.

                        Overall, SAS Insights gives an interesting look at the idea of "big data," its past, and what it means in the business world. Big data analytics has the power to change everything, and this shows how important it is to not only collect data but also use it well to gain insights and make smart decisions. Organizations can deal with the problems and take advantage of the chances that come with big data by using the five V's as a guide, Volume, Velocity, Variety, Variability, and Veracity. This will help them succeed in today's data-driven world.
